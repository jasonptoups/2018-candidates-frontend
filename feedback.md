# Project 2 Feedback

* Remove user file

## Technical Requirements	- Excelling

> Includes many well-structured models, good test coverage, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

Awesome job using Vue for this project, it is really cool to use a frontend framework before we even teach them!

## Creativity and Interface	- Excelling

> The app is fully responsive. App incorporates modern UI themes, and/or adds unique flair.

Your app looks awesome -- you could make it more responsive when you have more time by moving the filter to the top or even removing it.

## Code Quality	- Performing

> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues	

Your backend code looks really awesome, nothing really to give feedback on there other than reformatting your data coming from your models in order to make the filter functionality. I also noticed a couple empty files, which I would remove in a production application. I also would probably use Vue's CLI so that your components are organized by file and you have the other nice things it provides like highlighted templating and such. I worked on getting the filters more DRY, and I think that you could. I think reformatting the data would be even more effective though, and make that even easier.

## Functionality - Excelling

> App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc.

I really like the way the user can interact with the app. Really cool!

## Planning - Excelling

> Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of planning tools, such as Trello or GitHub Projects, and incorporates workflows such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions.

Looks like you planned ahead given [this](https://github.com/jasonptoups/2018-candidates-backend/blob/master/planning/project-idea.md) file!

## Specific Feedback

> I need help DRYing up the code in my script.js file, at the very end. There's a lot of comments there about it.

I put some inline code in the file! I would work on restructuring the data, that will help a lot.
